Here's a test run at this website

<iframe <src="CoopTract.html" heigh="500" width="500"></iframe>

You can explore this map [as its own web page here](CoopTract.html).

  This map seeks to do a few things
  * Geocode addresses compiled into the UHAB database
  * Provide background on geocoding reliability through icon design
  * Show clustering
  * Show target variables in the contexts that the Housing Coops exist in, as a proxy for the coops themselves (UHAB's concept)
